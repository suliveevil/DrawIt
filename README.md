Manual

A plugin for drawing vertical, horizontal, and slanted lines using text.
With DrawIt, one may use the number pad to leave a trail of dashes, bars, etc behind.
Furthermore, it also supports using visual-block specified regions to draw boxes, ellipses, arrowheads, lines, and to specify floods.
New: 
DrawIt has two new commands, :DIsngl and :DIdbl, that tell DrawIt to draw boxes using utf-8 box characters (single-bar, double-bar).
Your current file needs to be using the utf-8 encoding for this to work.

Also available at vim.sf.net where you may rank it. The version here requires vim 7.0!!!
